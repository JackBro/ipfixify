                              IPFIXIFY FOR MRTG
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF IPFIXIFY?

- centralize your MRTG data with a deployed NetFlow/IPFIX solution

- ability to modify your MRTG configs to include a grouping context
  This will allow users to categorize each configuration file

- Generate reports based on filtering in some NetFlow/IPFIX solutions
  
  For example:
  
        Target[port-3-inet-rtr]: 3:public@192.168.1.1:
        MaxBytes[port-3-inet-rtr]: 193000
    --> Groups[port-3-inet-rtr]: Internet,Pipes,Routers 
        Title[port-3-inet-rtr]: Port 3 on inet-rtr
        PageTop[port-3-inet-rtr]: <h1>Port 3 on inet-rtr</h1>

  More than one group can be specified by separating each with a comma.

- Option to run MRTG every minute instead of every 5 minutes.

  NOTE: this can affect any existing implementation you have and is
        only recommended for MRTG environments that are primarily for
        sending MRTG data to an IPFIX Collector.

CONFIGURING MRTG:

This section assumes you're running MRTG 2.17.4. If you are running a
different version, consider the DIFF files mentioned below.

IPFIXify was designed around the fact that users have been running
MRTG with one or more established mrtg.cfg files. Therefore, it was
our intent to minimize changes that could affect the existing
implementation.

For those without any manual modifications to the files mentioned
below, a user could simply back up these files and overwrite them with
the ones in the contrib folder:

  CONTRIB/IPFIXIFY/ DIR                          BACKUP AND OVERWRITE
  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  mrtg-modified/2.17.4/bin/mrtg               -> bin/mrtg
  mrtg-modified/2.17.4/lib/mrtg2/MRTG_lib.pm  -> lib/mrtg2/MRTG_lib.pm
  mrtg-modified/2.17.4/lib/mrtg2/ipfixify.pm  -> lib/mrtg2/ipfixify.pm

NOTE: ipfixify.pm doesn't exist and it is simply a copy from the
      contrib folder to the lib/mrtg2 directory.
      
Once you copy the ipfixify.pm file over, you will need to edit it and
change the IP Address and port to where IPFIXify is installed at lines
145 and 146.

Additionally, you will need to install the Net::Syslog module.

If you have a modified version of MRTG or a different version, you can
see the differences between the files mentioned by looking at the
mrtg-diffs directory.

Once these steps have been completed successfully, restart mrtg and
include the command line parameter --ipfixify
IPFIXIFYAGENT_IP:IPFIXIFYAGENT_PORT.

  For example:

    perl.exe mrtg mrtg.cfg --ipfixify 10.1.1.10:515
